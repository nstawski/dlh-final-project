    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type of problem\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This is a data preparation and processing problem. The authors of the article are testing a common belief that adding more data improves the resulting model performance. Their main hypothesis, which they subsequently prove, is that incorporating more data does not necessary improve the model performance. It can introduce spurious correlations, and hurt the resulting model performance rather than helping it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the importance/meaning of solving the problem\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The paper is challenging a common belief, meaning a lot of researchers are likely trying to incorporate as much data as they can expecting it would improve the performance of their models. The outcome of this research would provide guidance on the possible pitfalls and the cases where you wouldn't want to add external data - so it could set a new standard of processing and incorporating data for everyone in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The difficulty of the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "  The problem is non-obvious and the paper is challenging the common belief held in the industry. The authors are putting a lot of state-of-the-art approaches to the test, and attempt to quantify the results as well as provide new standards and explanations. This is extremely hard to do so I believe the problem is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The state of the art methods and effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "  The \"industry standard\" way of improving model performance is adding more data from additional datasets, which the authors of this article prove to not be effective, and even being harmful in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "  One of the main issues causing the model performance decrease when adding more data from other sources is spurious correlations, which in case of x-rays could be coming even from the scanner artifacts, or other hospital-specific data. One of the state-of-the-art ways to mitigate this is balancing a dataset to reduce the influence of hospital-specific factors. While balancing definitely improved the situation, the resulting model performance was still in many cases worse than with a single-hospital dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paper explanation\n",
    "### What did the paper propose\n",
    "The paper used four most-used chest x-ray datasets - MIMIC-CXR-JPG, CheXpert, PadChest, ChestXray8 - to disprove a popular belief that adding more data always would improve the performance of your model. They postulate that, for the specific x-ray data, even the scanners themselves, the way hospitals produce data, or send specific patients to specific places to do their scan, can introduce spurious correlations which, in many cases, significantly affect the worst group performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the innovations of the method\n",
    "Existing research (for example, John R Zech, Marcus A Badgeley, Manway Liu, Anthony B Costa, Joseph J Titano, and Eric Karl Oermann. Variable generalization performance of a deep learning model to detect pneumonia in chest radiographs: a cross-sectional study. PLoS medicine, 15(11): e1002683, 2018.) proves that adding a second dataset improves the average per-group accuracy. In contrast, the paper I am reproducing focuses on the worst per-group accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How well the proposed method work (in its own metrics)\n",
    "According to the article authors, their method works really well and proves that in nearly 50% of cases adding a second dataset, and even balancing it to reduce spurious correllations doesn't get the model to perform better than without that additional dataset. The models pick up on hospital-specific features even if those features weren't explicitly defined in the original data. They postulate that every CNN model, regardless of training disease or datasets, learns embeddings that can distinguish any of the hospital sources with near-perfect accuracy, even if the embeddings were trained via one or two hospitals’ data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the contribution to the reasearch regime (referring the Background above, how important the paper is to the problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "The article cautions against blindly adding more datasets, and provides a number of approaches you can take if you still decide to do so. The conclusion is adding more data shouldn't be done blindly. The authors of the article definitely discourage the researchers from the most common approach of throwing data at the problem to improve model performance.\n"

Each dataset has a different set of diseases but they are preprocessed using code derived from ClinicalDG2 (Zhang et al., 2021) to extract the eight common labels and homogenize the datasets. Additionally, authors of the article created the Any label which indicates a positive label for any of the seven common disease labels, resulting in nine different binary labels. All experiments use the labels in a binary manner; a pathology is chosen as the target label, with an instance labeled 1 if the pathology of interest is present and 0 otherwise. \n",

    "The model includes the model definitation which usually is a class, model training, and other necessary parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model architecture\n",
    "In the article, the authors use the same model architecture as Zhang et al. (2021): a **DenseNet-121** network (Huang et al., 2017) initialized with pre-trained weights from ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). The final layer is replaced with a **two-output linear layer** (for binary classification). For simplicity, the authors only consider binary disease classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Training\n",
    "For training the network, all images are resized to **224 × 224** and normalized to the ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the following image augmentations are applied:\n",
    "* random horizontal flip\n",
    "* random rotation up to 10 degrees\n",
    "* a crop of random size (75% - 100%) and aspect ratio (3/4 to 4/3)\n",
    "\n",
    "All runs use **Adam** with **lr = 1e-5** and **batch size = 128**, which was found to be a performant configuration in early tuning ((Zhang et al., 2021) use lr = 5e-4 and batch size = 32).\n",
    "\n",
    "All test results are obtained using the optimal model found during training as measured by the highest validation macro-F1 score (following (Fiorillo et al., 2021; Berenguer et al., 2022)) as it gives a robust ranking of model performance under imbalanced labels."

    "# Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Is the paper reproducible?\n",
    "It is too early to tell right now, but at least a portion of the code provided is runnable with minimal updates. I was able to reproduce the initial dataset statistics, so at least that portion is definitely reproducible. The rest will depend on whether I am able to solve and run the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If the paper is _not_ reproducible, explain the results\n",
    "TBD depending on whether the paper results will be reproducible or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What was easy and what was difficult\n",
    "The authors did a great job documenting some parts of the project, for example, access to data. Following the instructions was very easy, and while MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset access took some time to get, overall the process was a breeze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Downloading the datasets is a hassle though, I ran out of space on my laptop, had to buy an external drive and restart the download process for MIMIC-CXR-JPG a few times. In the end, I got a message from my provider that my namely \"unlimited\" internet for the months was used 100% and I will be charged for each extra GB I use.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few notebooks and standalone scripts provided to process the data. While it is possible to figure out what steps need to be done in what order, many of the parts of the process are not documented. 'pyproject.toml' did not run successfully for me, and I've been stuck trying to figure out why and how to run it (I have a suspicion my processor architecture is not supported, but not enough experience to tell for sure yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "In parallel, I opted to re-implement the training and model validation myself. There is code for training and validation in the project, which has a lot of comments (great!), but the process itself is not well documented, so the reproducer is left figuring out which steps in the code are needed and which are not, and how to adapt it to use for their experiment. The code is very general and there is a lot of it. There are some pointers in the readme, but they are at this point not sufficient for reproducing things successfully without additional modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "wandb isn't really working for me either yet, and I am yet to figure out why it is needed and whether it is necessary to reproduce the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is not processed evenly / equally for each dataset, there are different values for the same labels (NaN, True/False, 1/0, 1.1/0.0). I had to write some processing code to make sure we mitigate those differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional complication is due to the fact that the amount of data is very large. Any training or processing takes a long time, the notebook kernel dies frequently and the overall process is frustrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried to avoid multiple separate files and scripts, and pulled many of the data preprocessing into my notebook. However, this increased the runtime of the notebook significantly. Additional factor affecting the runtime is the size of the input data, even when working on one dataset. I doubt it would be possible to achieve the 8 minute runtime, but will try to do so.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Suggestions for the author\n",
    "\n",
    "Trim the codebase leaving only relevant parts. Add documentation for the training and validation process. Add some background on why wandb is used and how to use it for this project correctly. Provide a suggested order of execution for the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plans for the next phase\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remaining time until the final submission May 7 deadline, my plans are:\n",
    "* Further update the data processing functions so they are producing similar type results (right now while compatible, it's a mix of _int_, _float_ and _True/False_, I would like to homogenize the resulting dataset further)\n",
    "* Finalize the training for the model and compute worst per-group accuracy for all data combinations listed in the article (so far I had the most issues with training, as the code supplied with the article didn't work and I had to come up with my own in which I try to replicate the experiment as close to the article description as possible)\n",
    "* Plot the results and finalize the writeup (compute both worst per-group accuracy, and AUROC and compare to the results of the article)\n",
    "* Prepare a subset of data and optimize the notebook to run under 8 minutes if at all possible (as per the original requirements) - this might be complicated as the main focus of this article is dealing with more data and all datasets are quite large. Randomly picking samples from each dataset might further introduce some unintended spurious correlations\n",
    "* Check the main hypothesis on both balanced and unbalanced datasets, time permitting \n",
    "* Prepare a video presentation\n",
